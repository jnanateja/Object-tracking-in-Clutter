# Object-Tracking-in-Clutter

I implemented three different algorithms for tracking n-objects in clutter environment.

#### Global Nearest Neighbour
More detailed description of this algorithm can be found in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6178056).

#### Joint Probabilistic Data Association
More detailed description of this algorithm can be found in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4046781).

#### Multiple Hypothesis Tracking
More detailed description of this algorithm can be found in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1263228).
